üöß Development Journey: Challenges & Solutions

Building Cine Review involved overcoming several key hurdles:

Replit Environment Issues: Persistent PHP "command not found" errors and file casing problems were resolved by explicit Nix configurations and targeted code workarounds.

Robust URL Routing: Ensuring clean, consistent URL parsing across different server environments.

Dynamic UI for Reviews: Implementing a two-step process for AI review generation and subsequent user editing/saving, requiring careful state management.

Database Schema Alignment: Correcting and evolving the database structure to support all application features.

Deployment to PaaS: Transitioning from a local development environment to a production-ready PHP hosting platform.



üöÄ Getting Started
Clone: Get the project code from GitHub.

Install: Run composer install.

Database: Set up MySQL/MariaDB and run the SQL schema for users and ratings tables.

Configure: Set your DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_PORT, OMDB_KEY, and GEMINI_KEY as environment variables on your hosting platform.

Launch: Deploy to a PHP-compatible PaaS (like Render) or run locally (e.g., on Replit).
