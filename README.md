This is a small movie rating web app I built using PHP and MySQL. The main idea was to create a simple platform where users can log in, search for movies, give their own ratings, and get an AI-generated review based on what they thought of the film. 

They can then publish the review on the site for others to read.

Built with PHP, MariaDB, gemini (for reviews)
